This function should implement the following tasks:
<br>Add another column in the table called days-per-year, which contains the number of days per year for each planet. Do this by dividing the orbital path length (2pi*1,000,000*distance_from_sun km) by the orbital speed (orbital_speed km / Earth Day), which will result in the number of days per year.
<br>Rank the planets by number of days per year.
<br>Return a String with the name of the planet with the greatest number of days per year.
