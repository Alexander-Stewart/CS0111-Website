Valeria Tiourina</p><h4>1.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Goals)"></a>Goals</h4><p>CS0111 provides an introduction to computing and programming that
focuses on understanding, organizing and manipulating data. Students
will learn to write programs to process both tabular and structured
data, to assess programs both experimentally and theoretically, to
apply basic data science concepts, and to discuss big ideas around the
communication and use of digital information.</p><p>Designed for both concentrators and non-concentrators, this is the
first in an eventual three-course introductory sequence leading into
advanced CS courses. This new sequence spreads out the material from the
two-course intro sequences to help students who need to accommodate
other time demands or interests.  Programming assignments will be
smaller scale than in CS0150/0170/0190, while still cover sufficient
content to put students on a path to a CS concentration if they wish.
Each of the three courses is also a reasonable stopping point in its
own right, so students can apply what they have learned to problems in
other domains if they so choose.</p><h4>1.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Time_.Requirements)"></a>Time Requirements</h4><p> In addition to three hours per week in
lecture, you will spend 2 hours a week in lab and 6-8 hours on
assignments.  There will be three kinds of assignments: very small
practice exercises due twice a week, homeworks, and projects.  Either
a homework or a project will be due each week.</p><h4>1.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.After_.C.S0111)"></a>After CS0111</h4><p>This course will be the first in a three-course sequence (0111, 0112,
0113) that will lead into the CS concentration.  However, neither 0112
nor 0113 will be offered in academic year 2018-19.  If you expect you
will concentrate in CS, you are likely better off taking CS0150 or
CS0170 this year.  As an experiment this year, students who earn A&rsquo;s
(and perhaps strong B&rsquo;s)
in CS0111 and wish to accelerate into further CS will have a chance to
do extra work over winter break to prepare to take CS0180 in the
spring. This option is not guaranteed to be available in the future.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Course_.Culture__.Diversity__and_.Professionalism)"></a>Course Culture, Diversity, and Professionalism</h3><p>(adapted from Professor Krishnamurthi&rsquo;s policies, with permission)</p><p>Creating an environment in which all students are comfortable learning
is extremely important to the course staff. Some of the responsibility
for that lies with the staff, but a lot of it ultimately rests with
you, the students.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Be aware of your actions</span></p><p>Sometimes, the little things add up to creating an unwelcoming culture
to some students. For example, you and a friend may think you are sharing in a
private joke about other races, genders, cultures, etc, but if you do
this in a public space and a classmate overhears it, it can have
adverse effects. There is a fair bit of research on something called
"stereotype threat", in which simply reminding someone that they
belong to an particular culture or identity (on whatever dimension) can
interfere with their class performance.</p><p>Stereotype threat works both ways: you can assume that a student will
struggle based on who they appear to be, or you can assume that a
student is doing great based on who they appear to be.  Both are
potentially harmful.</p><p>Bear in mind that diversity has many facets, some of which are not
visible.  Your classmates may have medical conditions (physical or
mental), personal situations (financial, family, etc), or interests
that aren&rsquo;t common to most students in the course.  Another aspect of
professionalism is avoiding comments that (likely unintentionally) put
down colleagues for situations they cannot control.  Bragging in open
space that an assignment is easy or &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;, for example, can send
subtle cues that discourage classmates who are dealing with issues
that you can&rsquo;t see.  Please take care, so we can create a class in
which all students feel supported and respected.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Be an adult</span></p><p>Beyond the slips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of
explicit behaviors that the course staff, department, and university
(and beyond) do not tolerate. These are generally classified under the
term <span style="font-style: italic">harrassment</span>, with sexual-based harrassment a specific form
that is governed by federal laws known as Title IX.</p><p>Brown&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.brown.edu/about/administration/title-ix/policy">Title IX
Web site</a> provides many resources for understanding the terms,
procedures, and policies around harrassment.  Make sure you are aware
enough of these issues to avoid crossing a line in your interactions
with other students (for example, repeatedly asking another student
out on a date after they have said no can cross this line).</p><p>Your reaction to this topic might be to laugh it off, or to make (or
think) snide remarks about political correctness or jokes about
consent or other things. You might think people just need to grow a
thicker skin or learn to take a joke. This isn&rsquo;t your decision to
make. Research shows the consequences (emotional as well as physical)
on people who experience harrassment. When your behavior forces
another student to focus on something other than their education, you
have crossed a line. You have no right to take someone else&rsquo;s
education away from them.</p><p>In light of recent reports about such issues on campus, Brown is
taking additional steps to reduce this form of harm. Therefore, if we
cannot appeal to your decency, intelligence, and collegiality, let us
at least appeal to your self-interest. Do not mess around on this
matter. It will not go well for you.</p><p>Framed more positively, treat each other as professional
colleagues. Someday you may be each others&rsquo; start-up partners or
co-employees; one of you may even be the other&rsquo;s interviewer or
boss. So start treating one another like professionals, and we mean
that in the best possible interpretation of that phrase.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Issues with Course Staff</span></p><p>Professionalism and respect for diversity are not just matters between
students; they also apply to how the course staff treat the
students. The staff of this course will treat you in a way that
respects our differences. However, despite our best efforts, we might
slip up, hopefully inadvertently. If you are concerned about classroom
environment issues created by the staff or overall class dynamic, please feel free to talk
to us about it. Professor Fisler and the HTAs in particular welcome
any comments or concerns regarding conduct of the course and the staff.</p><p>Sometimes, you may not be comfortable bringing this up directly to
us. If so, you are welcome to talk to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~ldobler/">Laura Dobler</a> (the CS dept
diversity coordinator) or to the Department Chair,
<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/ugur-cetintemel/">Ugur Cetintemel</a>. You may also reach out to Rene Davis in the Title
IX office.</p><p>As a department, we will take all complaints about unprofessional or
discriminatory behavior seriously.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">One Caveat</span></p><p>Please be aware that as the Associate Director for Undergraduate
Studies for CS, Brown considers Professor Fisler a Title IX
<span style="font-style: italic">responsible employee</span>; she is thus required to share information
about (suspected) incidents of sexual and gender-based harm or
discrimination with Brown&rsquo;s Title IX office.  Contact Professor Fisler
or the Deans&rsquo; office if you aren&rsquo;t sure who to turn to if you need help.
For more
information about Brown&rsquo;s policies and resources, please see the
university&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.brown.edu/about/administration/title-ix/policy">Title IX
Web site</a>.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Textbook__.Software__and_.Materials)"></a>Textbook, Software, and Materials</h3><p>There are <span style="font-style: italic">no required textbooks</span> for this course, and <span style="font-style: italic">you
do not need a computer!</span> There are ample machines in the Sunlab (CIT
143), Moonlab (CIT 227), MS Lab (CIT 167), etc.  Many students have
laptops and use those to do much of the course work, or have desktop
machines and use those, but neither is necessary.</p><p>You also don&rsquo;t need to purchase any software; the programs you write
will all be written using publicly available and free software.</p><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Laptop_.Policy)"></a>Laptop Policy</h3><p>Students increasingly multitask in lecture: checking email, working on
other homework, browsing social media, texting, etc. Research
increasingly shows that these activities are highly distracting and
detrimental to <span style="font-style: italic">other students</span>.  Students sitting around you
can&rsquo;t help but be distracted by the lights and colors on your
screen.  (For a summary of the research, check out the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2018/laptop-policy.html">summary</a> that
Professor Krishnamurthi has prepared for his courses).
Some Brown CS professors have begun surveying students about
laptop distraction, and many students report this as a frustration and
a problem.</p><p>As such, this course has a strict policy on the use of devices during
class:</p><div class="emphbox"><p>Use of laptops during lecture is limited to taking course
notes or working on in-class exercises. We request that students using
laptops to take notes sit at the edges of the room to minimize
distraction for others. Students using laptops for other purposes
(email, web browsing, social media, etc) will be asked to put their
laptops away.  Phones may not be out or used at any time during
lecture except in an exceptional situation. In such a case, please
inform the professor before lecture begins.  If you absolutely need to
use your phone during class, step out of the classroom.  </p></div><p>Laptops are not needed for lectures or for taking notes. We will do
many exercises on paper; when we do try to write code, it will be
small enough that you can just as well write it by hand (some research
suggests that hand-writing notes leads to better learning and
retention anyway). Shortly after each lecture, we will post notes and
lecture video online, so you need not transcribe the lectures. A
notebook used to highlight key points should suffice.</p><h3>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Assignments_.Overview)"></a>Assignments Overview</h3><p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Almost) Daily Drills</span></p><p>Twice a week, we will post a short set of review problems that check
your understanding of each day&rsquo;s lecture content.  These are designed
to help everyone have sufficient grounding in the concepts that will
be referenced before the next lecture. The problems will be posted as
quizzes in Canvas, but the quizzes aren&rsquo;t graded for correctness (only
for participation), so that you can use them for learning.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Labs</span></p><p>Labs are two-hour, interactive programming sessions designed to let
you practice concepts in a collaborative space before you need those
concepts on homeworks and projects.  Lab signups will happen at the
start of the course. Lab work will be done in small groups, with each student
working with different partners across the course. Each lab features
checkpoints at which you&rsquo;ll need a TA to check your work so far.  Once
you complete the final checkpoint at the end of the lab, you are free
to go.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Homeworks</span></p><p>Homeworks are designed to help you internalize the course material.
They consist of written problems and short programming tasks.  These
problems may only be discussed with fellow students and TAs in a
manner consistent with the Collaboration Policy.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Projects</span></p><p>Each project has two deadlines: one for a design check and one for the
final hand-in.  The purpose of the design check is to make sure your
design is reasonable before you begin coding.  You will generally have
about a week between the project release date and the date of your
design check, followed by another week to complete the project.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Exams</span></p><p>There&rsquo;s only one exam, a paper-and-pencil final that will occur in the
course&rsquo;s assigned final exam slot.
Details about the exam and what you should expect on each part will be
posted a few weeks before the exam.</p><h3>6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._grading)"></a>Grading</h3><p>Everyone who earns an A gets one. Your grade is independent of the
grade or work of any other student in the course.</p><p>The various course activities bear the following weights in computing
course grades:</p><div class="itemtight"><ul><li><p>Homeworks: 30%</p></li><li><p>Projects: 30%</p></li><li><p>Labs: 10%</p></li><li><p>Daily Drills: 10%</p></li><li><p>Final Exam: 20%</p></li></ul></div><p>For <span style="font-weight: bold">homeworks and projects</span>, you will receive grades in each of four
core skills: (1) producing correct programs, (2) choosing data
structures and modeling problem data, (3) testing and debugging
programs, and (4) decomposing problems and structuring programs. Each
homework/project can earn points towards one or more themes (varying per
assignment).</p><p>Your final homework and project scores (as used to compute final
course grades) will be based on your performance across the skills.
An A requires a strong grade in all four themes; B requires two strong
grades, another good grade, and no below-par grades; multiple
distributions could earn a C, but more than two below-par grades would
not earn credit).</p><p>Grades within a theme are based on several factors, including scores
on each assignment, grade trajectories across assignments, and
performance on work done individually. Some students may struggle in
the beginning as they get used to programming, then get stronger as
the course goes on. Grading in this course aims to accomodate this
normal learning curve; to do this, we cannot publish a formula up
front of how individual assignments will weigh in final grades (no
single formula covers all students). You will receive feedback as the
course goes on about your overall performance, so you can allocate
your efforts according to any grading goals you have.</p><p>For <span style="font-weight: bold">labs</span> your grade will be based on attending lab and making
good progress on the problems during the lab session. You do not need
to complete the entire lab to get full credit, but the staff do need
to see consistent effort during the lab time with many parts of the
lab completed. Partial credit is available.</p><p>For <span style="font-weight: bold">daily drills</span> your grade will be based on the percentage of
daily drills that you submit. Full credit will be given for submitting
answers to all questions on 80% of the assigned drills, as long as
there is no clear evidence that you&rsquo;re just clicking through without
thinking about the questions.</p><h4>6.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Blocklists)"></a>Blocklists</h4><p>To avoid conflicts of interest in grading, TAs may not grade students
with whom they have current or past close personal or professional
relationships.  Either students or TAs may declare grading conflicts.
If there are a particular TAs who you feel should not be
grading your work, please contact the HTAs or Professor Fisler so we
can configure grading assignments accordingly.</p><h3>7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Course_.Policies)"></a>Course Policies</h3><h4>7.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._collaboration)"></a>Collaboration Policy</h4><p>Our collaboration policy attempts to balance the benefits of students
learning together and the need to work problems on your own for
understanding.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Labs</span> are done in groups of 2-4 students, depending on the activites in
a particular week.  There are no restrictions on collaboration within
lab groups.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Projects</span> are done in pairs.  There are no restrictions on
collaboration within project pairs. Project partners are expected to
work on the entire project <span style="font-style: italic">together</span>, rather than to divide the
project into parts to complete separately.  Dividing the work defeats
the learning goals for the project.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Daily drills</span> should be done alone, as they are designed to help you
and us assess whether you understand the concepts needed for the next lecture.</p><p>No collaboration is allowed on the <span style="font-weight: bold">final exam</span>.</p><p>For <span style="font-weight: bold">homeworks</span>, you are permitted to discuss high-level ideas with
other students, but you must produce your code and other responses on
your own. In particular, the
following activities are <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> allowed when working on homeworks:</p><div class="itemtight"><ul><li><p>Sharing code files with another student for any reason other
than being partners on a project or lab</p></li><li><p>Sitting next to another student while writing up solutions while
looking at what the other is typing</p></li><li><p>Sending code for a homework question to a classmate "just so they can look at it to figure out how to do the problem"</p></li><li><p>Obtaining a solution on-line, or from someone not in the course</p></li><li><p>Leaving your work in unprotected directories or services
(including github) where other students can find them</p></li><li><p>Showing a classmate your code so they can help you find or debug
an error</p></li></ul></div><p>In contrast, the following scenarios are fine:</p><div class="itemtight"><ul><li><p>Asking the course staff for help</p></li><li><p>Classmates discussing an assignment question at a more general
level than the code: discussing what the question is asking, what
topics it draws on, and other similar non-code issues</p></li><li><p>Asking a classmate what general causes of a particular error
message might be, or for debugging strategies, without showing them
your code</p></li></ul></div><p>We will follow Brown&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/policies/academic-code">Academic Code</a> procedures on any suspected violations. Note that
those who provide solutions are held partially accountable, even if
they didn&rsquo;t think the other student would use their work.  <span style="font-style: italic">We
understand the pressure to help friends when they ask: please don&rsquo;t
put other students in the position to say no to such requests.</span></p><p>If you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask.
There is never a penalty for asking.</p><h4>7.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Handin_.Policy)"></a>Handin Policy</h4><p>Every other assignment handout contains a section entitled &ldquo;How to
Hand In,&rdquo; which you must follow in order to hand in your work
electronically.  <span style="font-style: italic">We will not accept hard copies of your
assignments, or handins via email.</span></p><p>When handing in assignments, make sure you name your files using the
file names provided.  <span style="font-style: italic">The handin tools will not accept wrongly
named files.</span></p><h4>7.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Contesting_a_.Grade)"></a>Contesting a Grade</h4><p>You are encouraged to look over your assignments after they have been
graded.  If you find a possible error or believe that you lost too
many points, contact the TA who graded that problem.  You should
initiate such inquiries within one week of receiving your grade. The
grading will be freshest in your TAs mind during this time, and this
prevents a backlog of requests from arising towards the end of the
semester.</p><h4>7.4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.One-time_.Lab_.Switches)"></a>One-time Lab Switches</h4><p>If you discover that you cannot make your lab section during a
particular week, you can email the TAs to temporarily switch into
another lab section.  <span style="font-style: italic">You should send this email at least 24
hours in advance of your scheduled lab. </span>  That way, the TAs will have
sufficient time to read your email, help you find an open slot in
another lab, and confirm the change.  <span style="font-style: italic">If you email the TAs with
less notice, say only 2 hours in advance of your scheduled lab, and no
TA is able to help you before your usual lab time, you are expected to
go to your assigned lab.</span></p><h4>7.5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Late_.Policy)"></a>Late Policy</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Labs</span>
are expected to be completed in the lab during lab time, barring
emergencies.  Most labs have some activities that involve discussing
solutions or ideas with others that you cannot complete on your own.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Homeworks</span> that are turned in on their due date, but beyond the
published &ldquo;due time&rdquo; (usually 9:00pm on Tuesdays, unless stated
otherwise on the assignment handout), will be considered late. We will
grade your work with a 10% penalty if it arrives by 6:00pm the next
day (when we start grading). You will receive no credit on any
homework that comes in after 6:00pm the next day unless you have an
extension in email from Professor Fisler.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Projects</span>
have two deadlines: a design check, in which you review your
project plans with a TA, and a final submission deadline. You will
sign up for design checks after each project is handed out. Missing
the design check will cost you 30% of your project grade.</p><p>Final project submissions are subject to the same late policies as
homeworks.</p><h4>7.6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Extensions)"></a>Extensions</h4><p>Extensions are generally granted only for documented situations, such
as illness with a note from health services, or personal issues with a
note from a dean.  Deaths in the family are valid reasons that do not
require documentation.  If you feel you need an extension and don&rsquo;t
have documentation, contact Professor Fisler.</p><p>Only Professor Fisler can grant extensions, so please do not ask any of
the TAs for an extension.</p><p>Only in the most extreme of circumstances is an extension or time
change granted on the exam.</p><h4>7.7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Accommodations)"></a>Accommodations</h4><p>If you feel you have physical, psychological, or learning disabilities
that could affect your performance in the course, we urge you to
contact <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/accessibility-services/">SEAS</a>. We
will do whatever we can to support accommodations recommended by SEAS.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Religious Observance</span></p><p>If you require accommodation for religious observance, please contact Professor Fisler at least a week before the deadline in question to make arrangements.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Personal Emergency</span></p><p>In the event of a medical or family emergency, contact Professor Fisler to work out accommodations.</p><h3>8<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Where_to_.Get_.Help)"></a>Where to Get Help</h3><p>Our goal is to guide you as you develop the skills, knowledge, and
confidence to solve computational problems correctly, elegantly,
efficiently, and with ease.  Part of your learning experience
throughout your time at Brown, will involve a productive struggle with
problem solving.  If/when you encounter feelings of frustration, don&rsquo;t
be afraid to ask for help.  Rather than beat your head against a wall,
seek out your friendly staff.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">We are here to help!</span></p><h4>8.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Piazza__.Email__and_.Contacting_.Staff)"></a>Piazza, Email, and Contacting Staff</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Piazza</span></p><p>We use an online academic forum called Piazza to handle questions and
comments that arise outside class and office hours. All questions about
course material and assignments should be posted to Piazza. If you
email a question that should have been posted, we will ask you to post
it before we respond.</p><p>Piazza allows both private and public posts.
Unless a question pertains specifically to your attempted solution to
a problem, please post questions and comments publically. Questions
about your approach should be posted privately (i.e., to the course
instructors only).  The course staff reserve the right to make a
private post public if it asks a general question of interest to the
entire class.</p><p>Before you post, do a quick piazza search or check the FAQ on an
assignment handout to see whether your question has already been
answered. We will periodically update the assignment FAQ as questions
come in.</p><p>Lastly, feel free to comment on any questions/answers/comments you
read on Piazza.  Piazza is a forum for discussion and we welcome your
contributions!</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Email</span></p><p>Questions or comments not directly related to the course material (for
example, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t log in to Piazza!&rdquo;)  should be emailed to the
entire course staff (cs0111tas@lists.brown.edu).</p><p>The only exception to this general rule is in the case of a grade
complaint; then, you should start by contacting your specific grader.
If you and your grader cannot resolve the issue to your satisfaction,
you can then contact the head TAs (cs0111headtas@lists.brown.edu).</p><p>You can also email the head TAs about other more personal concerns,
such as a personality conflict with your partner on a project.  If the
head TAs cannot resolve your issue or answer your question, feel free
to contact Professor Fisler.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Quiet Hours</span></p><p>TAs (and the professor!) have their own work and lives beyond this
class. As a result, each staff member maintains times during which
they will not be checking Piazza or answering email. As a general
rule, questions posted to Piazza after midnight may not get answered
before the next morning. Professor Fisler goes offline no later than 9pm
each day.</p><h4>8.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Office_.Hours)"></a>Office Hours</h4><p>Each TA holds two hours of walk-in office hours, per
week.  Professor Fisler has one scheduled hour and is available for
appointments outside of hours.  Each week&rsquo;s schedule and location is
posted on the course website.</p><p>Attending
office hours does not send a message to your
professors or peers that you are falling behind.  Au contraire, the
most successful students are usually those who come to hours
<span style="font-style: italic">early and often</span>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>whenever they have questions about topics
covered in lecture or would like some guidance as they work through an
assignment.</p><h3>9<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Receiving_.Announcements)"></a>Receiving Announcements</h3><p>Announcements will be made on Piazza.  If an announcement is
time-sensitive, it will be emailed to the entire class.</p><div class="emphbox"><p>You are responsible for keeping up to date with
all messages, regardless of where they are posted. In particular, you
are responsible for any assignment clarification that is posted at
least 48 hours before the assignment due date.</p></div><h3>10<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Ergonomics)"></a>Ergonomics</h3><p>Repetitive strain injuries are a common side effect of computer use,
and can be serious.  Refer to the
<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/about/system/ergo/">CS department&rsquo;s resource page on
ergonomics</a> for information on how to reduce the chance of injury when
working with computers.</p><h3>11<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Data_and_.Research)"></a>Data and Research</h3><p>Throughout the course, we will be analyzing data about how the class
as a whole is doing on various concepts, with the aim of improving the
course in future years. Professor Fisler does research in computing
education, and may sometimes combine anonymized data from this
offering with data from other similar courses. Your identity will
never be shared beyond the staff of this offering of the course.  If
you have any concerns about this, please contact Professor Fisler.</p><p>You will also receive invitations to participate in a couple of
research studies associated with the content of this course.  These
are strictly voluntary, and have no bearing on your standing in the
course.  While Professor Fisler will post announcements about these
studies, she will not know who chooses to (not) participate in them.</p></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
